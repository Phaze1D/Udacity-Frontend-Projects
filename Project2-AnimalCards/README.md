# Animal Trading Cards
> Udacity Frontend Nanodegree Project 2

This project is about creating an HTML template from a PNG image. It is meant to simulate the progress that happens when a designer creates a mockup of a reuseable template, and a developer has to transform that mockup into correctly semantic HTML with CSS. I also changed the information that was being displayed on the PNG image with new information to see how it would fit the template. 

## Usage
You can view the PNG that needs to be built [here](design-prototype.png), and you can view my results by opening [card.html](card.html) file in your browser


### Comparison

| PNG  | HTML |
|----|----|
| <img src="design-prototype.png" height="400px"/> |  <img src="readme_imgs/gray_wolf.jpg" height="400px"/>    |
